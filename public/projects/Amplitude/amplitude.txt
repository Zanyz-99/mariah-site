Re-Imagining Ostiense Station | Rome, Italy

Located in the Ostiense neighborhood just southeast of the ancient Aurelian wall, the Roma Ostiense Station sits at the convergence of ancient Rome with the industrial quarter. A once-bustling station constructed in 1938 by Benito Mussolini, the station serves as one of the main arrival points for migrants coming from other areas of Europe, Africa, and Asia. The station has been altered significantly over the years to meet changing programmatic needs and adopt new technology, but still retains its imposing Fascist architectural character. I approached this project with special considerations to preserve the functions of the train station as a facilitator of travel, to continue the pathway of movement along the unofficial market stalls that approach the station along the Viale delle Cave Ardeatine, and to establish housing and resource offices for migrants arriving in Rome.
