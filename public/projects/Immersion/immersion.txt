Immersion explores the studio’s theme of “Memorials in Landscape” through the adaptive reuse of the Sinking Ship Parking garage, located at the intersection of two conflicting city grids in the historic Pioneer Square in Seattle. Prior to its triangular formation, this land was inhabited by the Suquamish who likely settled in rectangular cedar structures along the shore of the natural fish pond to the south, and has since been the site of three hotels and a parking garage. The 1960’s era concrete parking garage is a relic of the site’s tumultuous past and representation of conflicts past and present. Immersion seeks to create a creative sovereign space for underrepresented groups to gather, make, and grow. The pods are designed to be disassembled and reassembled within the structure of the grid to provide a variety of spaces for a variety of needs or uses. The structure is intended to be ever-changing and adapting to the needs of the public.
