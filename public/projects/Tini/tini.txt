Tiny House Research Studio | Seattle, WA

Tini began as an exploration of modular, flat-pack, prefabricated housing solutions that utilize digital fabrication and commercially available materials. As a group we began studying the WikiHouse model, a CNC prefabrication method developed in Great Britain, that uses carefully designed tension-fit dovetail joinery that allows a homeowner to design and build their own with just a CNC machine and plywood. We explored this method with an aim to leverage digital design and fabrication for the public good to create adaptable and affordable housing.

Working alongside the Low Income Housing Institute (LIHI), the Hope Factory, and residents of Tiny Home Hope Villages, we used the Tiny Home as the base model for our exploration with the intention to offer alternative building methods that provide shelter for the unhoused and support the operations of LIHI and the Hope Factory. Under strict dimension restrictions for these Tiny Homes which are in place to speed up construction and permitting, we prototyped several approaches to enhance the WikiHouse model, and ultimately developed and tested one full-scale solution. Some key goals include making the system accessible and enjoyable for volunteer builders, ensuring flexibility for various user needs, addressing storage issues, and designing for durability and disassembly (DfD).
