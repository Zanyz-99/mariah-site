Scandinavian Furniture Design Studio

A professor of mine once said that fashion is close-body architecture, and I think the same is true of furniture. It is architecture on the most human scale.

Inspired by my grandfather’s relentless obsession with circles-within-squares, I approached this studio with the intention of finding a ‘close-body’ architecture version of this form.

Cut at an angle from one triple-ply oak square, the circle is separated from the square and lowered to form a seat and back and are supported by simple blackened-steel legs and stretchers.
